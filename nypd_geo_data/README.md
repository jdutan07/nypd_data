The reason that the notebook in this folder is separate from the main notebook is because I wanted to practice learning on how to create, use, and manage conda environments.
This entire notebook was created in its own environment. Needless to say, I learned a lot on isolation purposes, package compabilities, command line terminal functions, and etc.
