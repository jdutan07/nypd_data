The purpose for this Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on NYPD Complaints Incident Level Data is due to the increase of crime throughout the city. I wanted to practice and improve my data analysis and visualization skills, while also creating a meaningful project for the public. After cleaning and manipulating the data, I formed and answered various questions that people may have regarding the uptick of crime in NYC. I hope this project inspires others to engage in analytical projects based around public necessity for information.

**IMPORTANT INFOMRATION REGARDING THE DATASET**
The NYPD Complaints Incident Level Data was created on October 28, 2016 and was last updated on July 22, 2024 (based on the time I accessed it). I accessed the dataset on September 30, 2024 and extracted the data with a timespan of January 1, 2021 to September 30, 2024. Despite the timespan for data extraction, the earliest data entry appears to be from 01/03/2021 to its last data entry on 06/30/2024. This was concluded after inspecting the data in its original and cleaned formats. Please see the additional information below for clarity.

There are two date_time columns:
1. Date of Occurrence
- Earliest Date of Occurrence is 01/03/2021
- Latest Date of Occurrence is 06/30/2024

2. Date Event was Reported to Police.
- Earliest Date Event was Reported to Police is 01/01/2024
